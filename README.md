#The Starting Line

Task was to make a quick prototype of a landing page for a sports shop.

Specs were to:
- Inform visitors that the full website is launching soon.
- Show them how to find the bricks and mortar store.
- Be slimline, it's a very simple prototype, don't overdo it.
- Look good.

I used Sinatra to provide a simple backend. Bootstrap provided most of the styling, and the Google Maps API gave me a mockup of a map.
